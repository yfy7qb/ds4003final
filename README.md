### Dashboard building process:

Given that the assignment was divided into "sprints", the dashboard sort of organically came together. Keeping the user experience in mind, though I shifted the scope a bit, was key in making sure I was displaying the information I found critical. Additionally, having a layout in mind as I was coding made the coding process much easier, as I knew what I wanted to get done.

The first roadblock I ran into was around data cleaning. I had never used pandas before this class, so I really struggled with data cleaning, especially given the quantity of data I had to clean and the amount of columns. I was definitely helped by only having one numeric variable (the number of votes), but going through and cleaning was still challenging. Ultimately, I was able to clean for both 2016 and 2020, especially with the help of some classmates.

I had also never used Plotly before this class, so the coding of the dashboard itself was quite difficult. I ran into a lot of roadblocks, especially with the map graph. The solution I ended up coming to was not the best, but I ended up creating a seperate dataframe for that data. If I had a bit more time, I would have tried to have it all run out of one data set, but it also significantly reduced the load time, which is especially important given Render's low amount of RAM.

Even though it might not be the cleanest dashboard, I am proud of how far my skills have developed over the course of the semester. I came in with very rudimentary Python knowledge, and my understanding of Python, as well as confidence in coding as a whole, has greatly improved.
